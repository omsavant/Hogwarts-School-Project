                 A large, freshwater lake (a loch, actually, since this is Scotland) lies to the south of Hogwarts castle, which stands on a cliff overlooking the water. The lake has a number of very unusual inhabitants, including a giant squid (a semi-domesticated squid as it lets students to tickle it's tentacles while basking in the sun in shallow waters), a village of merfolk, and many grindylows. The lake is approximately a half-mile in diameter. The lake is also known as the Black Lake. Every school year at Hogwarts, first years sail across the lake to the castle led by a teacher in boats as per Hogwarts tradition. When they get to the school, they are then Sorted into their houses. The Giant Squid also helps people if the are drowning in the Black Lake where The Giant Squid lives in. <br>
